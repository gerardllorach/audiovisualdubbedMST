# How to create video material for the Matrix Sentence Test
This is a repository with guidelines and code to create visual material for Matrix Sentence Test for speech audiometry. Please read the [scientific manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04700) first, if you haven't.

## Getting the audio-only material
The audio-only material belongs to HörTech gGmbH. In principle, they can give you the material for research purposes for a limited period of time. You will find contact information on their [website](https://www.hoertech.de/en). The specific website for the MST can be found in this [link](https://www.hoertech.de/en/devices/intma.html). You can directly specify that you need it for creating an audiovisual MST and that the audio files are required. 

The audio-only MST from HörTech will be mentioned as "original audio" throughout this guide.

## Recoring setup
You will need a computer, a camera, a microphone and probably a sound mixing table/handheld recorder. Each setup will depend on the equipment that you have available. We propose a setup with a mirrorless camera, a shotgun microphone and a handheld recorder (Zoom H6).

### Audio routing
The camera needs to record two audio inputs at the same time: one from the talker (captured by the shotgun microphone) and another one from the computer, where the original audio is being played. Because most cameras have one audio input, the Zoom H6 will mix the captured audio and the computer audio. The line out of the Zoom H6 will be connected to the audio input of the camera. The shotun microphone will be connected to the Zoom H6 channel 1 and the computer audio to the Zoom H6 channel 2. The computer will have two audio outputs from the headphone output. You can achieve that with a jack splitter. One of the outputs will be connected to the Zoom H6, as mentioned before, and the other will be connected to the earphones that the talker will use. You can also use an external sound card to do that. The final connections should look like this:
Microphone ----------- connected to ------ Zoom input channel 1
Computer audio output ----------- connected to --------- jack splitter input
Jack splitter output 1 ----------- connected to ----------- Zoom input channel 2
Jack splitter output 2 --------------- connected to -------------- earphone to the talker
Zoom line out ------------------ connected to -------------- Camera audio input

## Recording settings
- Camera: 
   · record at 50 or 60 fps, 1080p (full HD). At 50 fps, one frame equals to 20ms. Ideally, the camera records in mp4 or some other standard format.
   · avoid using automatic settings. If you do so, maybe the camera settings change during the recording session and one (video) sentence might look different from another.
   · use optical zoom if you have, in order to separate/blur the background. You can also play with the aperture to blur the background (specified as f/<number> in cameras).
   · choose a location without natural light (to avoid light changing throughout the day).
   · do not use automatic gain control for audio
- Microphone:
  · use a shotgun microphone (also called boom I think) or a cardioid microphone, close to the speaker (e.g., above the speaker or below at the height of the knees and outside the recording frame of the camera).
  · check out this video for mic setups: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cusxbkwyvQ4.
  · never let the audio signal go over -12 dB in the camera and in the handheld recorder.
